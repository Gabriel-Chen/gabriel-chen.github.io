This is a voice controlling car project built with my lab partner Thomas McClave. SIXT33N can bu controlled with four commands which mean to drive the car straight, slowly straight, turn left, and turn right. All voice commands are classified by Principle Components Analysis, and driving correction is controlled by Closed Loop Feedback.

The follow is a picture of how SIXT33N looks like:

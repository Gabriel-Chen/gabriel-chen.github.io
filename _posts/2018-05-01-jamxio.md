Jamx.io is a project trying to approach environmental justic in Mexico with a different way. It means to get everyone in the community involved using social media APIs and SMS message. It retrieves data with keywords such as water pollution, air pollution, and ect. into the database, then plot the geojson coordinates on a map which can be visualized through the platform.

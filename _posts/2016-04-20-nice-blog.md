Nice Blog is a Jekyll website framework built with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a framework to build a personal website and host it on GitHub. There are five parts in this theme besides the index page, archive, category, tags, about, and contact. The reason I wrote this is that I wanted a clear and simple Jekyll theme to be out there after I saw so many unnecessary and unpractical features within a website. Right now, this project is open sourced on GitHub and has 54 stars and 37 forks.

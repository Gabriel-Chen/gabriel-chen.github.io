Ada is an information provider and daily reminder robot built by Raspberry Pi and Python. She provides me the weather information every morning after she wakes me up. Everyday, if I have classes to go or assignments due, she is going to remind me so I can catch up with every thing on time. Right now, she is smoothly working on my studying desk and ready for more features.

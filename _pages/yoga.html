	  As a certified Yoga teacher and registered Yoga Alliance RYT-200 Yoga teacher, I am very proud of bringing more mindfulness using my own knowledge.
	  <p>
	  Through more than eight years of self Yoga practice, Yoga has cured my body both mentally and physically. Now, I am glad to start teaching Yoga and contributing to this great international community. I found my own peace through practicing Yoga and hope you would find the same inner peace as I did.

	  Besides being a Computer Scientist, I am an internationally certified Yoga teacher. I was fortunate being trained by Kristin Rooney, and I am very proud of bringing more mindfulness to this community using my own knowledge.

	  Through more than ten years of Yoga practice, Yoga has cured my body both physically and mentally. It has being helping me with increasing body stability and muscle density for archery and martial arts practice. Now, I am glad to teach Yoga and contribute to this great international community. I found my own peace through practicing Yoga and hope you would find the same inner peace as I did.

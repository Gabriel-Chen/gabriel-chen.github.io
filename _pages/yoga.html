	  As a certified Yoga teacher and registered Yoga Alliance RYT-200 Yoga teacher, I am very proud of bringing more mindfulness using my own knowledge.

	  Currently, I am offering Yoga sessions at CSC Pasadena. I host a Monday Morning Refreshing Yoga session every Monday from 10am to 11am virtually. If you are a member of CSC Pasadena, please join us on Zoom and all levels are welcome.

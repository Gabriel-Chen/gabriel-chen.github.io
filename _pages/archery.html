	  Barebow Archery and Hunting has been one of my practices since very young age. This simplest way of shooting arrows gives me the clearest mind while scouting animals.

	  I practice Gao Ying's archery with recurve hunting bow. And I usually scout around Northern California (D3, D4, D5, D6), Southern California (D13, D11, D14), and Mojave Desert (D17).
